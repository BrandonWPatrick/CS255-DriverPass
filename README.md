DriverPass Portfolio Submission

Project Summary

The DriverPass project was designed for a client called DriverPass, who wanted a system to help students prepare for their DMV driving tests. Their goal was to combine online practice exams, on-the-road driving lessons, and tracking tools into one platform. The system also needed to support staff roles, such as the secretary scheduling lessons, the IT officer managing user access and security, and administrators generating reports.

What I Did Well

I think I did a good job clearly capturing the client’s needs from the interview transcript and translating them into functional and nonfunctional requirements. My UML diagrams also helped break down the processes visually, which made the system easier to understand at a glance.

What I Would Revise

If I had more time to revise, I would refine my class diagram to better show how different objects interact with each other. For example, I could expand the relationships between packages, instructors, and vehicles. Adding more detail there would make the design stronger for developers picking it up later.

Interpreting User Needs

I relied heavily on the interview transcript to make sure every client request was reflected in the design, like tracking student progress, handling package options, and staying up to date with DMV rules. Considering user needs is critical because even a technically perfect system is useless if it doesn’t actually solve the client’s problems or feels confusing to the end users.

My Approach to Software Design

My approach to design was to break the system into smaller, manageable components. I started with the big-picture requirements and then modeled processes and interactions using UML diagrams. Going forward, I’d like to add more early user feedback loops and maybe even quick prototypes, since hearing directly from users can prevent rework later on. I’d also keep using diagrams because they make it easier to spot gaps before coding begins.
